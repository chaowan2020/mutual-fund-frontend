# Mutual Fund Frontend

This repository contains the frontend code for the Mutual Fund Dashboard and Analysis project. Built with ReactJS, it includes components for displaying fund trend charts, dashboards, and analysis features. The frontend interacts with the backend to fetch data and provides a user-friendly interface for querying mutual fund information.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed. You can download them from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mutual-fund-frontend.git
   cd mutual-fund-frontend
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
**The application will run on http://localhost:3000.**  

## Project Structure
* src/components: Contains React components for the dashboard, fund chart, analysis, and query.
* src/services: Contains API service for making HTTP requests to the backend.

## API Integration
The frontend communicates with the backend to fetch mutual fund data and handle user queries using the following API endpoints:

* GET /api/mutual-funds: Fetch mutual fund data.
* POST /api/genai/ask: Ask a question to the GenAI model.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
